Through the course, we will work on 15+ case studies of real-world AI problems and datasets to help students grasp the practical details of building AI solutions. For each idea/algorithm in AI, we would provide examples to provide the intuition and show how the idea to be used in the real world.\n",

      "Adding more content to the current course would make it quite bulky for most of our students to finish and stay motivated through the course. Hence, we did not add Reinforcement Learning (RL) to it as of now. We do not want out our students to be overwhelmed by the course content and workload. While we want to add more content, we don't want to overburden the students.\n",

It should be easy for any of our students to pick up RL once they finish this course as they have all of the background in Maths and Deep-Learning.  Please note that no course can cover everything in ML. Often the content in this course itself is split across 2-3 courses. But we designed the course such that students can pick up new concepts fairly easily at the end of the course. Actually, some of our students have picked up RL at the end of this course fairly easily.\n",

In case if you are interested in  product development companies, along with ML, also gain strong command on CS fundamentals like Data Structures & Algorithms, Design Patterns, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS. Regarding the start up plans, once if you have some experience of around 3-5 years in the corporate, you can  think of a new startup because in order to run a startup along with the technical stuff, you also need management skills.\n",

      "Adding more content to the current course would make it quite bulky for most of our students to finish and stay motivated through the course. Hence, we did not add Reinforcement Learning (RL) to it as of now. We do not want out our students to be overwhelmed by the course content and workload. While we want to add more content, we don't want to overburden the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will probably create a new course (or) add RL to this course itself in the future (no guarantees) as optional topics. It should be easy for any of our students to pick up RL once they finish this course as they have all of the background in Maths and Deep-Learning.  Please note that no course can cover everything in ML. Often the content in this course itself is split across 2-3 courses. But we designed the course such that students can pick up new concepts fairly easily at the end of the course. Actually, some of our students have picked up RL at the end of this course fairly easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi\n",
      "Then I suggest please add another course for RL. I joined course not due to lack of material for ML online but due to organization and flow of course and the way you teach. So  I request you to please consider this request seriously. I will happily pay for another course from you.\n",

      "Thank you for your all efforts taken for designing such great content. Especially Varma sir's way of teaching and explaining difficult concepts in a very easy-to-understand manner is praiseworthy.\n",
      "I have been doing this course for 4 months now and from my experience, I can say that your hard work reflects through all the components of this course, be it teaching, live lectures, doubt solving or the assignments.\n",
