Hence we did not add Reinforcement Learning RL to it as of now. We do not want out our students to be overwhelmed by the course content and workload. While we want to add more content we don't want to overburden the students. We will probably create a new course or add RL to this course itself in the future no guarantees as optional topics. It should be easy for any of our students to pick up RL once they finish this course as they have all of the background in Maths and Deep-Learning. Please note that no course can cover everything in ML. Often the content in this course itself is split across 2-3 courses. But we designed the course such that students can pick up new concepts fairly easily at the end of the course. Actually some of our students have picked up RL at the end of this course fairly easily.</td>\n",
