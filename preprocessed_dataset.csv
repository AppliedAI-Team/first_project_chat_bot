question,answer
it is really great to see exponential growth of appliedai. team's efforts to consider each and every concern and work on it is very much appreciable. very soon appliedai will be one of top most and successful teaching platform.,thank you for the kind words and the trusting us. we make sure every student who has trusted us will succeed through our course.
i also want to make a startup like you in the ai field this course give me a good start for ml and deep learning. till the end of my b.tech i want to gain as much as knowledge as possible or i can say as impossible.now finished my first year. fully passionate for completing the case studies.,learn as much as you can from this course and after your 2nd year onwards start internships and by the time you sit for placements in your final year you will get as much exposure. in case if you are interested in product development companies along with ml also gain strong command on cs fundamentals like data structures algorithms design patterns operating systems computer networks dbms. regarding the start up plans once if you have some experience of around 3-5 years in the corporate you can think of a new startup because in order to run a startup along with the technical stuff you also need management skills.
sir thanks for wonderful suggestions. but what you suggest me regarding internships i want to get some real world exposure by doing internship in these summer vacations i completed 10 to 11 assinments now in 10 to 15 days i will complete all course content just case studies will left after that. i have full june month for completing some case studies and refresh concepts about machine learning then till the end of june i will apply for internsip. is this good idea.,make sure your internship does not clash with your classes in college. yes you can start applying for internship once if you finish the course. once if you finish all the course content there are chances for you to crack internships in top it companies
what are design patterns?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/software_design_pattern https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-set-1-introduction/
hi first of all thank you for great course can you please provide some modules for reinforcement learning.,adding more content to the current course would make it quite bulky for most of our students to finish and stay motivated through the course. hence we did not add reinforcement learning rl to it as of now. we do not want out our students to be overwhelmed by the course content and workload. while we want to add more content we do not want to overburden the students. we will probably create a new course or add rl to this course itself in the future no guarantees as optional topics. it should be easy for any of our students to pick up rl once they finish this course as they have all of the background in maths and deep-learning. please note that no course can cover everything in ml. often the content in this course itself is split across 2-3 courses. but we designed the course such that students can pick up new concepts fairly easily at the end of the course. actually some of our students have picked up rl at the end of this course fairly easily.
hi then i suggest please add another course for rl. i joined course not due to lack of material for ml online but due to organization and flow of course and the way you teach. so i request you to please consider this request seriously. i will happily pay for another course from you.,we will surely inform you once we have the reinforcement course ready or when we add rl as an optional content for this course.
hi team thank you for your all efforts taken for designing such great content. especially varma sir's way of teaching and explaining difficult concepts in a very easy-to-understand manner is praiseworthy. i have been doing this course for 4 months now and from my experience i can say that your hard work reflects through all the components of this course be it teaching live lectures doubt solving or the assignments. i have one suggestion it will be great if you make a telephone line available for doubt clarification regarding the assignments. many times it's a small workaround that fixes the bug but waiting for your reply via mail takes about a day and this in turn hampers the course progress. please make a telephonic helpline available for doubt clarification.,we encourage for doubts through mails. you can contact us at 918106920029/ 916301939583 in case if you are looking for a phone call conversation with us.
can we expect reinforcement learning to be added soon??..,please go through the comment thread: http://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/11/applied-machine-learning-online-course comment346
sir if this is the case then my suggestion would be to give some introduction course about reinforcement learning and make it as optional.,we will think of it.
it would be great in case there be a deep dive in reinforcement learning,so far we are not looking towards addding reinforcement learning. but in future we may add it and you will be able to access it.
once our validity gets over can we see those videos if you upload in future and do we need pay seperately for that ?,once if the course validity is over you will not be able to access any content in both website and classroom.
sir i3 processor with 8gb ram is fine to complete this course,yes it is enough.
can i learn artificial intelligence in the field of mechatronics?,please drop us your query at team@appliedaicourse.com. so that we can assist you better.
hi team i have 10 years experience in it. currently working in banking product implementation. my main concern is whether switching to ai/ml platform after 10 experience is right was forward. is it worth to take the risk of changing the domain now? my contact number: 98941 68004.,see i will suggest it is never late to switch the skills set.if you really want the edge over new skills you can consider it.it totally depends on the interest of one.
would like to suggest one functionality. if you would create one dashboard where will get a ranking based on the respective assignment. it will be great.,thanks for the suggestion
hi do i get certification after completing my appliedai course?,once after completion of the total course we will send the certificate of completion through email.
sir in google classroom we can see there are 30 assignments but in modules there are only 26 assignments including optional is the number of assignments are reduced?,you will see the other ones in the case studies at the bottom. also you will see them getting added in your classroom as you keep progressing through the course.
how many real-world projects can be done by your course in data science? how many real-world projects can be done by your course in machine learning? what is the average package of the students who got placed from your course? are all students get the same projects or each student gets different projects? waiting for reply. thanks in advance,please call us at 6301-939-583 or 8106-920-029. we will clarify all your doubts.
is the syllabus given fixed. i mean is the content team adding new lectures assignments or case studies ? it would be great to see reinforcement learning added at least as optional so as to not burden the student with heavy syllabus. rl is turning out be a very promising field in ml with very interesting applications .this would be really helpful for those who need it. thanks,syllabus is not fixed we keep adding the contents with time.we appreciate you suggestion and will look forward to it.
hi team can you please provide the assignments at the end of each module which will directly take us to google classroom's assigment? and provide tick like for videos once the assignment is completed and graded by you.,please drop a mail at team@appliedaicourse.com
hi aaic my friend attended interview with accenture with 2 years data science experience below are the list of questions was asked to him: 1. explain about yourself 2. explain the projects that you worked for 3. what is the difference between logistic and linear 4. what is sigmoid function 5. what is the difference between sigmoid and softmax function 6. what is validation 7. what s statification 8. what is bootstrap validation 9. what is cost function 10. why is cost function so important in model 11. when did you apply cost function 12. what is optimizer 13.i have 10 million records with 60 features what is your approch to build a logistic regression a. which validation you choose b. which model you choose c. which optimizer you choose d list the optimizers you know and explain the best one you choose for this problem e. where do you get the data ? is it from online or warehouse? 14.what is clustering and explain various clustering algorithms 15. write psudo code of density based clustering 16.have you ever worked on svm ? tell me the advantages 17. what is the node entropy 18. how is rnadom forest is different from xgboost 19. what are the most significant parameters for the xgboost 20 why you preferr xg boost for both liner and logistic 21. what is pca 22. i applied pca on 50 features and how many new feature will i get 23 what is eigan vector 24. how you deploy your model into production 25. what hadoop cluster you are using please give us some links or study materials if you find any topic missed in aaic course with respect to above-listed questions. thanks,these are some of the easier questions in interviews. we have covered all go these concepts except q-25 about hadoop in our course. for hadoop cluster i guess the interviewee mentioned that he is working on hadoop and hence he was asked which version of hadoop and which distribution of hadoop and probably what configuration he was using. we have also not covered q-1 as it changes from person to person
hi can you please explain what is your answer for below questions 22. i applied pca on 50 features and how many new feature will i get 13. i have 10 million records with 60 features what is your approch to build a logistic regression a. which validation you choose b. which model you choose c. which optimizer you choose d list the optimizers you know and explain the best one you choose for this problem e. where do you get the data ? is it from online or warehouse?,22. you can get any number of features
i am glad that all videos are searchable now and appliedai team really approachable and day by day you are getting better you are reaching the level customer satisfaction is utmost you guys are rocking...kudos to the entire team..,thank you for the feedback
i like this new site.can you add a feature where i can see the questions that i have asked and liked module wise and chapter wise ?,thanks for the suggestion
can you please describe how tough the assignment is is there nay video of that assignment so that i can judge myself because in most of the video they are saying that assignment are so tough that its impossible to complete the course in 1 year please give me some clarity,if you are motivated enough you can complete in 1year. if you watch all the videos and if you are clear with concepts you can complete assigments smoothly. some assignments takes time i.e also for machine to train the models and team is always there to help you out btw i completed in 1year except one assignment
so if in any case i am stuck at my assignments and i dont know what to do then who will help me and if u guys help me in the assignment then will i be consider for placements,we will be helping you out with the assignments and course queries. yes you will be considered.
and please tell how much students of yours have completed the full course in 1 year ratio wise ...i have a phobia of maths but i know programming ...so can i easily understand the algo like random forest knn nd other algo like these buy just watching your videos with 100 intrest,please send an email to team@appliedaicourse.com
by adding quiz at the end of every concept/chapter will help students better understanding and motivating?,as of now we do not have any plans of it. but in future we may add it.
i have 8 years of experience in it in .net technology but now i want to in ml field. so my questions/doubts are below:- 1 can i change my technology in this much experience and land in a good company as ml engineer. 2 this course is sufficient for me or some other course i need to do along with this. 3 how much it is difficult for me to switch to new technology.,kindly mail us your contact number to team@appliedaicourse.com so that we can call you and answer all your queries over the phone. also please mention what would be the best time to contact you.
is there content through which we can learn about video analysis image processing and its applications?,no right now we do not deliver these topics.we teach end to end ml and deep learning along with python and other tools like pandas numpy etc
will there be any content further? please add if possible they are my requirements for projects.,when the new content is added we will notfiy.
was any new content added i would like to know this to decide weather i should pay this course or not since machine learning is constantly evolving i would like a course that is constantly ipdaying with new content to keep the course uptodate it doesnt matter if the courses is lenghthy or not because at least we will be more prepared and have more things to learn the more the better so im just wandering is the course constantly updating its content,yes course is also constantly evolving as machine learning. every week course instructor will go live for 1-2hrs where he will pick a topic and go in great detail discussing about the topic
i have logged in with gmail but i want a seperate username and password to login. what should i do?,you can click on forgot password then you will get a password reset link through email.
sir i would like to do a phd in data science. how can the applied ml course help me? thanks in advance.,this course provides you with a good overview of most of the popular ml and deeplearning algorithms. but the mathematical rigor we go into is not at a phd level as we focus more on applied and practical aspects more than theoretical proofs. but we have many phd students who take this course to understand how various techniques are actually sued in practice.
just a suggestion : can you please put all the recorded audio for the query of student by module basis instead of finding it in the comments. this will definitely help student a lot and decrease some amount of question asked to you.,thanks for the suggestion
hi team i always had this query as we all know course validity is 1year and your team adds new content to the playlist every now and then as per your youtube live sessions so how can 1year old student of this course can access the new content if not then would not it be a loss for him in terms of knowledge gain. please help me with this query and also let me know business timings of your team to have a phone call conversation before i enroll this course. cheers,the validity of course is 365 days. you can call use between 10 am-6 pm.
i also would like to know. i keep coming back to this website and thinking about enrolling but no access to material after 365 days throws me off. i really like the course - to me it would make sense if i do not have access to assignments and future updates. i should have continued access to video content that i use as revision or reference. all other major program providers are giving the live time access ...,please drop a mail at team@appliedaicourse.com
i do not know the team's idea regarding 365 days validity but in my opinion if the course is life long validity students will not feel the motivation at all to complete it. it just makes us lazy day by day. we may keep on postponing it for 2 years. that is not at all helpful to someone who wants to grow as ml engineer or data scientist. if one has that utmost interest to complete the course within some stipulated time even if it is lifetime validity then it is sure that he can definitely complete it in one year. what it requires is sheer concentration and interest to learn. if it is a limited time period although we may feel hurry at sometimes we can learn at our own pace and extend the validity after a year and get a highly qualified job. purpose served,yes you are correct. this is the reason for 1-year validity.
access to course content is different to an actual program. you have dated assignments and deadlines that you have to complete to pass in 365 days. having access to content for future review is something appliedai should consider. other ml program providers are already doing it. that way you will also gain more students. sure make deadlines for assignments/case studies/any deliverables but make content video lectures accessible for lifetime.,previously we used to have deadlines for the assignments but this course is not taken only by the students. even the working professionals are also enrolling for this course and they were not able to meet their deadlines as they have to balance their work home and this course. so we have removed the topicwise deadlines but we have kept the course deadline of 365 days like that only. also 365 days of time is sufficient to complete all the assignments of this course provided if you consistently putting your efforts.
hello sir do i need to watch the live sessions in each module after the completion of course videos of each module or can i first watch all the course videos complete the assignments and then watch the live sessions? watching live sessions are necessary for assignment completion or should i watch them after i have completed the assignments?,we recommend you to watch the live sessions associated with each topic immediately after finishing the chapter asociated with that topic. this way you could learn the topic in much more depth as most of the live sessions are the deep dives of the topics.
dear team a small suggestion to implement if possible. could you please highlight the item of table of content in the right if we are watching the particular item video ? for example module 3 chapter 1 we have 20.4 as bag of words. if we are watching the same bag of words item on the right side in table of content should be highlighted.,thanks for your suggestion
could you please add comment section under each assignment in classroom so we can get clarifications and clear our doubts about the corresponding assignment. the slack does not help as it is not inituitive to use also we cant even see past comments beyond few days. it being not organized as per assignment also makes it even difficult to use. the video in assignment is not enough as lot of time we are stuck trying to solve a problem because of a assumption we eneded up making just having a comment section helps in removing and clarifying those doubts. a comment section below each assignment would help a lot.,there is a comment section for each assignment but you can access it once you try to submit the assignment please refer to this link. the comment section is placed on the left side of the image.
it would be preferable to have a comment section where the details of assignment are given. as there is lot of small doubts about what the assignemnt is asking or when there is a bit of ambiguity eg in formulas if everything is in summation or part of it. or if while taking samples is it with or without replacement. such little confusion take up a lot of time. so if others have such issues those can be resolved in comment and can be answered. because the team still takes a day to answer. common doubts can quickly get resolved as once the team answers the confusion can be removed once for all,thanks for the suggestion
1.do we have to complete the live session videos in chapter 1 compulsorily to get course completion? 2. will it be added for other modules as well apart from python?,just to clarify course completion is not about the video completion but about the assignment completion
do you recommend 1st year engineering students to join the course or wait till second year till all the fundamentals of cs is clear?,first year student can join because all the programming fundamentals are also covered in the course. person with no programming background can join.
hello team thanks for the new look of the website with additional features. just wanted to provide some suggestion on the navigation of the particular topic w.r.t breadcrumbs on the top in each of the topic page. for example log normal distribution in probability and statistics can be displayed like below: home - courses - applied machine learning online course- data science : explanatory data analysis and data visualization - probability and statistics - 12.15 log normal distribution now it's displaying like below : home - courses - applied machine learning online course- log normal distribution if the same is implemented we can navigate to any of the module chapter or topic etc.,thank you for the feedback we will include it in our next iteration of updates.
sir which white board tool youare using for conducting the session?,we use ink2go.
do we need to do log transformation on both dependent variable and independents variables in linear and logistic regression,usually it is done on independent variables.
sir..as srikanth sir mentioned in live session there will be interview questions after each chapter.. but i cant able to find that.. can you please guide me where ill found that or give any link of them..,in each module you can find a few chapters named 'interview questions on topic'. the questions start from probability and statistics chapter.
hi sir i wanted to know what type of projects we can put in resumes after completing the course as we cant put netflix recommendation system amazon food reviews as our projects so please suggest what type of projects we can put in resume to get calls.,you can put the case studies covered in the course as projects in your resume. but we would suggest you put your own self case studies other than those covered in the course. you will get more ideas as you go through videos.
hi for microsoft malware case study can i do this on google colab instead of google cloud or azure ?because i cant do it on local machine.,yes you can run that on google colab.
have this course contain anything about reinforcement learning?,as of now reinforcement learning is not yet added but in future we may add it to the course.
please add it in the course because without reinforcement learning ai is incomplete i think.,thanks for the suggestion
have this course contain any videos about q learning?,no we have not covered q-learning in this course.
sir can i get a job in tier-1 companies just with the completion of this course with 80 in assessments or i will have to do something else additional .,yes you have to finish the case studies in this course and we have mentors to guide you in preparation for the companies you target for and also we help you with profile building that matches the company's expectations.
can in this course have any content for in depth use of various deep learning libraries like tensorflow and pytorch keras etc.,we have used tensorflow and keras in the course.
can i get any certificate after finish this course ?,yes you will get a course completion certificate if you finish all the assignments and get them evaluated.
what the system requirement need for this course.,it is good to have a laptop with around 8gb of ram minimum with i7 processor 4g graphics card from nvidia if you want to run deep learning programs which is optional generally 1050ti and above is preferable . you can also look into google colab for running the code.
if i use google colab then can i use properly all of things in this course or it give me a limitation.,you can use google colab. there is no limitation.
hello what are the prerequisites to join this course? do we need to know any programming languages or have an understanding of ai?,there are no prerequisites for this course. a programming language is taught in the course.
hi team i want to learn datastructure and algorithms.and i know only python which i learned from here.so please guide me.,you can refer geeksforgeeks to learn data structures and algorithms. you also can refer the book introduction to algorithms here.
please increase the logged in session time. after watching a 30 min video it again ask for login. it is really frustrating to keep login every time. once the login is done it redirects to the main website page then again we have to traverse to machine learning course page then again to our module and then click to next video. please understand this minute but irritating problem and solve it. thanks,thank you for the feedback. we will do the needful.
what can the applieai team say about the average package from the job gaurantee programme for a fresher ??,the average package for a candidate depends on different factors like the candidate's educational background skillset the candidate possess type of the company the candidate is trying for type of projects/portfolio the candidate has worked on etc. we suggest you to kindly call us on 91-8106-920-029 for further queries regarding the job guarantee program.
hi team is there a place where we can view all the questions we have asked on this platform along with the responses received? that way its much easier to reference than checking/finding for the right email after some time. thanks akeel,hi. we do not have that feature yet.
hi team suppose i am on a specific video but i visit the webpage after a few hours. the website says content restricted. please login which is fine. however after i login i am taken bacvk to the homepage where i have to again go to a chapter and select that video. is it possible to automatically relog me back in to the current page i am on. that would be great thanks :,we will check once if we have any bug we will try to remove that. but f you are not logged in any other computer then you will go the same page where the session got inactivated because of time. if the session got inactivated because of the other login from another ip then after relogin it will go to the main page.
hi team thanks for the response. it appears that if i click on a video after my login has expired it says 'content restricted .. please login'. after i login i am redirected to the course home page. note that i am using the same ip.,thanks for your confirmation. we will look into this issue with our sde team. if we have any bug we will rectify it.
there is no real-world case study on solving regression problem. if there is one case study on that too then it would be very helpful.,please look into taxi demand prediction case study.
hi team thanks a lot for the great course .one suggestion i would like to add here .most of the candidates may ask questions that are not relevant or that question is already posted in comment sections so its fair from your side not to approve those comments . but we all know each and every doubt is important so even if you do not approve please send one mail elaborating doubt and the reason for not approving those comment . it would help a lot .,thanks for your suggestion and we are doing the same thing now.
can you please suggest some reference textbooks that can be used along this course.,https://github.com/yanshengjia/ml-road/blob/master/resources/hands 20on 20machine 20learning 20with 20scikit 20learn 20and 20tensorflow.pdf check out this
there is a lot of inconsistency in video players of each lecture. sometimes its a youtube player which when paused shows recommendations which most of the times blocks the entire screen when watching on phone. sometime its a vimeo video player which sometimes has but sometimes does not have a full screen option. each page does have a full screen option which covers the page not much issue on a browser but a big issue in phone as browser address bar take a lot of space. other times the video player has full screen option which properly goes full screen. the problem is none of this is consistent constantly the format switches from lecture to lecture. which bearable on a laptop but extremely problamatic on a phone. could all the videos use one consistent video player. which does not show recommended videos gives a proper full screen option and a video playback speed modifier almost available on all videos when watching on laptop but missing in half the videos when watching from phone . consistently without any constant changing formats its a big issue when trying to view on phones. please do the needfull,thank you for the feedback. we will look into it.
i have reached the end of module-1. should i do sql now or after deep learning?,we suggest you to attempt sql assignment after finishing the deep learning assignments as we advise you not to waste much time on sql right now.
in module 3 often there is reference to sql database while importing the data. so would u suggest doing sql at the end of module -1 or after deep learning ?,you can work on sql assignment after completing deep learning assignments.
one suggestion:- if possible please try to add content around the model interpretation like lime shapley pdp etc and an introuction to git and github will also be a value add,thank you for the suggestion. we will look into it.
i have mechanical engineering degree with 3 years it experience of rest api developer. 1 what is the path to go into product base company except ml course? 2 will they consider my experience?,please call us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we can better understand your background and discuss with you in person
one concern:i am good at math logics and having experience of 2.8 years in programming .all the concepts till now i understood thoroughly but deep down i am scared that i may not complete course. i need some information like what is the minimum days that a student completed the course and landed in an ml job because i am from ece background deep inside me i had a feeling like what i have studied is wasted.here i am able to see vector matrix pdf cdf mean all the concepts which i have studied in my btech and 12th.i need some guidence and motivation,kindly mail us with this query and we will help you .you can call us at the provided phone number.
if you could provide a quick notes/bookmark option under each video dedicated to the user it really helps during our revision to quickly look back to important sections and videos. also a search mechanism when searched for a key work ex: covariance related videos popuping down would be a really helpful feature,okay we will consider this suggestion.kindly post the suggestion in our slack channel from now onwards.
one suggestion - please add applied ai course as a school as well on linkedin so that we can show what we have learned in detail.,you will actually get a certificate from appliedai once if you finish all the assignments. you can add the softcopy of this certificate on your linkedin profile and make it visible to the recruiters.
loved the way this new site is responding and the overall look and feel but a small suggestion only if its possible. is there a way you can showcase the total number of hours per module and overall hours. i understand that you mentioned that to be 150 hours but if we have the number of hours per module we can plan on completing the course module wise. just a suggestion not a mandatory ask. thank you.,sure we will be adding this feature soon.
new website is awesome. 1 suggestion: please add progress bar under module to track which sub-topic is not complete or you can add green tick if a sub-topic is complete. otherwise its cumbersome to track.,the percentage of completion of each module is already present in the website. within that if you have finished any sub-topic and have clicked on complete option then you will be able to see a green color tick mark
will registering for the course give me access to videos for unlimited amount of time?,the access to the course will be given for a period of 1 year. you have to finish the course within an year.
after finishing course what if i want to browse some of the videos later 2 or 3 years ? will i have access ?,at this point of time videos are accessible for 365 days only.
loved new ui of the applied ai. it's much stable dan previous one. ?,thank you for the feedback.
recently i was using old version of website. the some of the videos i completed are not showing in completed status in new website.,we are working towards it. within a short time it gets resolved.
hi team is this problem resolved bcos i am still facing this issue.,it has been resolved long back. please make sure you are logged in and check for the course and video status.
the individual progress is being displayed but not the overall process like in old site that also can be added.,yes it will be added soon
hi can you please clarity a doubt . will google automl eliminate the need for ml specialists in future ? please share your views regarding this. thanks pankaj,audio replies: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/automl-vs-ml-engineer https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/automated-ml
the content in each of the videos are intuitive also many tough topics are elucidated clearly. i really appreciate if you could also include more deep learning content along with reinforcement learning content which is totally absent in the course.,we intentionally left out reinforcement learning not to overwhelm the students. we have covered most of the key concepts in deep learning and would surely add more in the near future. thank you for your feedback.
sir i had 10 years of teaching experience in academics. i teach courses like probability and stochastic process image processing. i am presently pursuing phd on speech recognition . i am specifically oriented towards speech recognition and deep speech. i glanced through course and contents in deep learning as well. so will this course give enough prerequisites to understand and implement deep speech. or in other way can i choose project from deep speech which really helps in broaden my skills for my research? ps: i am also looking for job change after successful completion of assignments and project exclusively on speech can i expect assistance to specifically look at companies working on speech?,hi veerender this course covers all of the basics you need to build deep-learning based speech systems. we will also closely work with you on speech dl based projects. but we cannot guarantee you a job in the speech domain exclusively as there are limited openings in speech processing in india. we will certainly assist you but cannot guarantee you. if you are open to other areas of ml our job guarantee program is anyway applicable to all of our students.
hi i have 10 years of exp in it industry. i worked for 5 years in web development and past 5 years working as sql server senior developer. i have the background of stats in my degree. after learning your course can i get a job assistance in getting the opportunity from you. thanks,please call us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we understand your current role and better answer your question more accurately.
i have more than 10yrs of work experience primarily in it application development and maintenance. upon completion of this course will i get assistance from you for getting into a senior data scientist role with a significant upgrade in my pay package. i am open to discuss specifics over a call.,please call us 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we understand your current role and compensation better and be able to answer your question more accurately.
1. do you also cover the markov models? 2. also do you teach image processing as part of the course? as it will be required in few of the case studies that involve data as images 3. the case studies that are mention in the end like human activity recognition do you only give a brief overview or they are taught like rest of the others in detail? how do you go about teaching them? 4. we have to choose which case studies to pursue or we can try all of them out? how exactly do you go ahead about them?,audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/mehek-kawatra-comment/s-qvvlj
hi sir its better if the course includes a separate section for sequence models where the section involves techniques like hmm maximum entropy markov models conditional random fields. these are some of the good algorithms for nlp sequence labeling tasks.,audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/hmm-and-crf
the topics that are covered in aaic is so extensive that you would anyway feel overwhelmed but if you still need to cover hmms please do check out siraj's move 37 https://www.theschool.ai/courses/move-37-course/,mayukh we have not covered hmms as most applications like nlp and speech recognition which used hmms a decade back currently use rnns which we cover in lots of detail in this course including multiple case studies involving rnns. we have tried to cover the most important techniques used in the industry today and avoid those which are not extensively used as of now. but the course gives you the necessary tools and basics to learn most concepts of ml/ai at the end of the course as no course can cover everything.
hello i know that and i have told exactly that thing only. that aaic is very extensive. but if for some reason anyone still needs to cover hmms then that link would be useful. giving an additional resource would never harm right. ps. i am already pursuing aaic,thank you mayukh. certainly more resources are always better as students can get a broader perspective on various topics.

hi team i have one small question. i have realised that with continuous revision i have a very strong hold of the concepts taught in the course and i almost know the nitty gritty of almost every course video's topics however i tend to forget about the good things that i read from blogs. i tend to make notes of something good that i encounter in a blog but if i keep making notes of every blog now and then the notes would get so big that i would barely be able to revise them. so how do i efficiently remember the interesting things from the blogs? any suggestion? i know this varies from person to person but still if you could give some tips it would be helpful.,dont write long notes instead read those blogs and write summaries in your words and keep on revising / reading that summary so that it will be easy and time consuming.
hi team wanted to give a feedback about the comment section where in we write a comment. when we try to write a long comment it is really tough to scroll through such a small comment block could you please increase the size of the comment box? same goes with editing response which is even smaller so it becomes quite difficult to see which part we wanted to edit. thanks,thank you for your suggestion.

hello sir in the ridge regression model the equation has two parts a lamda b where a is the sum of squared errors and b is regularization term. how can we show that as lambda increases 'a' increases? thank you sir.,please go through this video.
hello sir can we prove it mathematically? if yes can you please explain it? thank you sir.,squared loss is y y 2 y w.x b 2 y y 2 y w.x b 2 y- hat y 2 y - w.x b 2 and regularization . w . w lambda. w . now our aim is to decrease the loss reg so i have the decrease the regularization term as well. now if my lambda increases my regularization term . w . w lambda. w will increase but i am trying to decrease the regularization term so w w w must decreases while optimization because of the increase in the lambda. if w w w is decreasing y y hat y will decrease and squared loss will increase. another important point is the threshold of lambda totally depends on data we have.

if i buy this course will i get lifetime access or access period is limited?,the validity of the course is 365 days.
may i know what is the reason for having a limited time period for this course?,the reason for having a specific time period is to create seriousness and punctuality among the students and make them finish the course and learn the concepts thoroughly within a specified time. if there is no specific time period it might take years and still most of the students will not be completing the course due to lack of seriousness. also the stuents might gets distracted from the course if they have infinite amount of time. hence we have specified the validity period as 1 year keeping not only the college students but also the working professionals in the mind. one year period is a sufficient amount of time for a new bie to start from the scratch and finish the course along with advanced case studies.
is there us certificate for free videos,you will get a certificate of completion only if you register for the course and finish all the assignments.

suggestion for new website: to include search option to search by word or keyword in comments section of every video so that we can search for some content in comment section among all comments of that video :,yes we are working on this thing now and try to make it soon.
one suggestion... please add estimated time to complete alongside time left which would estimate the amount of time required to complete the course based on the current pace.,sure we are working on it.

hi team the new website is amazing but please add the total course completed percentage feature as well. so that we can know how much percentage of the whole course is remaining.,yes we are working on it
please bring back the default in video full screen button,yes we will work on that
hello sir the new website is cool. i wanted to know if there is a change in the course content. in the previous website there were lecture videos on mysql which i can not find it here. also the videos on the live sessions are not available. thank you,they are shifted. but the videos are still there.. please go through each module and you will find them
which i observed in the link could not see the assignments list. by clinking assignments it is listing the topics only. it is not switching to assignments page.,assignments are there in their respective lessons.
few suggestions: 1. module 3 should be named appropriately module 4 named as machine learning ii so it will be ok here to just name module 3 as machine learning i only. 2. there are also supervised learning elements in module 3 but we are explicitly indicating it in the module 4 name supervised learning in bracket . this is creating confusion. other suggestion: 1. we would like to stay associated with aaic for life time or at least for a period of 4-5 years. please plan a package to accommodate the requirement. please come out with some economic plan. 2. include factor analysis 3. dataset used: please include case studies using dataset pertaining to financial industries non text based data ..this will help us to understand things at ease and apply in our domain. appreciate all your effort and leave these suggestions on to you to explore.,thank you for your suggestions. we will look into it
i cannot find the link for the old website,the old website is no longer available.
hello team i think how many days left is missing from the website?,we will add this feature soon.
i am not able to see the number of remaining days in the new website. pls add .,we will be adding this feature soon.
in real buisness world structured data isnot available so easily..so can u add videos depicting how we can build up our own datasets..,you will learn about it when you are working on case studies.
hi team the new website is fast. please add assignment name also,sure we will add it thanks for your feedback.
though the new site got wonderful l experience and performance over the old one if we add two more features 1-placing the completed at bottom of the video 2- instead of scrolling the complete web-page for video lectures/table of content it would be better if we separate both so that we can stay for the video lecture and the navigation is easy for the lecture content .,thanks for your feedback we are working on it and try to add these features soon.
there is offline videos means good incase internet not available our studies wont disturb,thanks for the suggestion we will consider this in future.
in old site we had lots of comments from which we used to get a better clarity can we not see those again?,comments are there below every video.
how can i access old site?,you can not access the old website.
is the overall progress removed?? that was a very good indicator of progress,it will be added soon.

hi applied ai team the new website looks great . it would be really helpful for the registered students if the new website displays the deadline count or in other words the number of weeks and days that's left for a student to complete the course .,yeah thanks for your feedback- we will try to add this feature soon.
hi in the old website the number of remaining days for the access to the course was displayed it was a good option can you please add this back to this new website as well,thanks for your feedback we will try to add it.
amazing website suggestions: 1. indexing chapter. 2. amount of time of playlist of module 1.40min just like vlc playlist would be awesome.this also helps breaking down studies in small section. 3. jupyter notebook of module all together do not want to download after each video. 4. link of all jupyter notebook dropbox link at bottom here 5. hoping i can see entire module video playlist at one time clicking and opening one video at time every 15min is distracting. 6 coursera course has simple quiz about concept which helps to evaluate we understood problem it is also rewarding. 7. app would be great p.s: website is great even at this point of time it is just high expectation to make it more convenient. -millennial student,thanks for your feedback we are working on it and try to add more features.
i am not able to see the live session videos which were there in the previous version adding them would really help a lot,we will try to add them soon.
hi team a new website has a very good design than the previous one. it is very good to make a plan for the study.,thanks for your review.
new website is really fast also arrangement of course content and age completion for each module gives clear picture of progress. good work,thanks for your review. :-
which option is best for this course and why? desktop pc vs kaggle kernels with gpu vs google collab,it depends a lot on the sepecifications of the systems and the case study you are solving. i would say explore all the free options that you have.. you would know their limitations and have experience those too. kaggle kernels and google colab notebooks are good but they have a maximum runtime limit. pc is good if it is really made well and you spend some good money. consequently you can also use google cloud if you have a credit card because learning good cloud is considered an extra skill in software industry.
hai i am 2008passout graduation i am eligible,yes you are eligible.we have the course from scratch we no pre-requisite required.

hi team under 'deep learning:neural networks' in module 8 the videos do not seem in the right order. ex. after 49.4 there is 'training mpl: memoization' which i cannot follow because it starts with computing derivatives of terms i do not understand how they were obtained. thank you.,we will look into it and will let you know if any corrections are made.
where are linear regression models and logistic regression and also ridge lasso regressions elastic net etc. those are missing. i believe these are important,they are present in the module 3 named logistic regression and linear regression. you will find regularization techniques in the chapter of logistic regression.
dear team it would be better for us if an option to view offline videos server download is provided. offline viewing option would help us to come over the network fluctuations that we usually face in most places especially during travel or commuting to office.,there's nothing like we should not standardize the numerical data. when we are working with counts based data it is good to standardize the data. in case if we are working on binary data there's no need to standardize the data.
hi. i am not able to find notebooks in new website. where can i download them from?,please drop an email to team@appliedaicourse.com regarding the notebook for the lecture you are looking for.

is this course covers all the topics like ml ai deep learning and data science? or only machine learning and deep learning?,we cover all of the core and foundational concepts needed for data science and we will cover all the things which are required for machine learning and deep learning.you can check out our syllabus.
i have seen rpa is much booming nowadays. how is rpa different from machine learning? which one is advantage and which one is good in terms of career? kinldy provide more information on this.,rpa is a fast evolving field with a good number of openings nowadays. but rpa is limited in its scope of what is automatable using specific tools. ml on the other hand is more generic and it can do everything that an rpa tool can do and much more. hence the opportunities for ml are a lot more across many industries and across a wide spectrum of problems. to be clear rpa is easier to learn and pick up as compared to ml. while ml is a more foundational skill rpa is mostly a functional tool. the choice boils down to how much effort you can put in. if you are willing to put in more effort and learn a foundational skill ml is the way to go. if you want to quickly learn a new and cool tool and ride the wave of opportunities rpa is a way to go.

sir i have heard that statistics is one of the most important if not the most important part of data science. so does it make sense to first get a solid understanding of the core concepts of statistics before starting with the course?? that way maybe one can get even more purchase from the lectures. or will the lectures under the probability and statistics section of the course suffice for understanding the statistics portion of the data science???,we cover all of the core and foundational concepts needed for data science on the probability and statistics chapter.
what is the eligibility for the job guarantee which you provide?,please call us on 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 to know more.
okay sir one more query to ask is this machine learning course complete or you will be adding more content to it?,the course is never complete as we constantly add edit and remove topics based on industry needs and students feedback. we have changed a very significant amount of of the course in the last 3 months. it is a very dynamic course
what is the difference between tensorflow and tensorflow 2.0? which part of this course will get affected by tensorflow 2.0?,tensorflow2.0 is yet to be released and there are going to some changes: https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8. most of the deep learning modules are covered in keras so it should not be too much of a worry.
hi it will be great if you can provide a keyboard shortcut to directly move to next video : . thanks pankaj,sure. will add it as a requirement for the next update of our website. thank you for your suggestion.
hi team could you pls tell me if i am working on insurance fraud claim.if it is being told that random forest is among the best algorithm then why not to apply it directly on the insurance dataset instead of trying any others since rf is well tested algorithm ? pls clarify in real world scenario. secondly what is smote?how to apply? thanks,1. why not use gbdt or svm or another method? why randomforest? it is best to choose the best-performing algorithm that also satisfies other business and real-world constraints like latency interpretability cost of training and evaluation availability of probabilistic class labels etc. it is best to try out various methods which satisfy the real-world constraints and pick the one that actually performs best. it is best to avoid any favorites. if the data shows that rf is the best method for your task then you should certainly go with it. 2. smote is a method to generate synthetic and new data-points using k-nn especially when we want to tackle the class-imbalance problem through upsampling. refer:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis smote
after successfully completing the course.am i able to create a chatbot?,yes you will be able to build a chatbot by the end of this course.
hi team what is the difference between regularized logistic regression and linear svm? thanks,both objectives have the same components: the loss function and the l2 penalty. it is also true that these two models often give very similar performance. however there is fundamental difference: logistic regression outputs probabilities and svm maximizes the margin. the point of svms is that is ignores all but the close points support vectors in the loss. in that sense it maximizes margin quite explicitly in a way that logistic regression does not.
hi team i see there is not a lot of nlp related content in the course. can you suggest a few links with good content for nlp?,this course consists of many of the important concepts from nlp ranging from simpler concepts like bag-of-words to state of the art rnns for nlp. we have introduced these concepts as the course progresses. we also have many case-studies which focus on nlp applications like quora-question pair similarity stackoverflow tagging personalized cancer diagnosis etc. audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/nlp-in-the-course-1 links: https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-natural-language-processing-nlp/ https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/ultimate-guide-to-understand-implement-natural-language-processing-codes-in-python/
i am curently in second year of engineering my cgpa is low around 6 cgpa even if i cover this course with good grades will i get offer from top notch companies. will cgpa affect my career in anyways?,please call us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that one of us can better understand your background and we can have a detailed discussion with you on this.
hi team i am from a testing background but i know coding basics as i have worked on selenium with java. i am having total 7yrs of experience in it as a tester but i really want to move to data science or ai. i want to change my career path will it be ok for me to move to ai or data science. after completing this course what will be the career prospect will i be a treated as a fresher in market. please suggest.,please reach out to us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we can have a detailed discussion with you on this.
hi how do we get requirement in which form in real world as it may be from multiple source and how do we make ready to use single format e.g. csv? how do we present our result to client? thanks,1. just like any project you talk to all the stakeholders to understand the project requirements in detail and document them clearly. 2. databases data-warehouses csv text-files etc. 3. mostly through plots and detailed writeup of the findings.
hi team why gbdt provides better performance and accuracy than bagging random forest ? pls elaborate. thanks,gbdt does not always give better performance than random forest. but many times we will get better performance because it trains tree based on errors of before tree. random forest makes many trees with random sample data and gives the majority vote.
why we are taking f0 x l yi-gamma instead of f0 x l yi-ypred as error should be initially yi-ypred to start with rather that not being yi -gamma in gbdt or xgboost? pls clarify in detail as i am totally confused. thanks,gamma in base model f0 indicated predictions values only. do not confuse with learning rate gamma that is different.
but as in wikipedia f0 x argmin_gamma sum_1ton l yi gamma here as written above gamma is a part/term of complete eqn. of f0 x . so how gamma in base model f0 indicated predictions values only ? pls clear me as always : thanks,please check in this video.
and one more query i want to ask is about the case studies - some times when we understand the concept and cannot work on case study but need some more understanding of the question being asked or sometime hints then can we contact you for the same?,we mentor you through the case studies that you would work on. more importantly you would have seen many case-studies in the course itself and hence you would be able to take our hints and proceed. of course you would have to put in a reasonable and non-trivial amount of effort from your end also.
hi team i went through some of the free available videos. and i could see that you are explaining the concepts in a fairly easy manner but my concern is about the code. i could listen the faculty saying that we can download the code using notebooks but what is the meaning of each line of code? which function is doing what? what else can we write to accomplish that same thing? as i am from programming background i know that we can accomplish one task with many different ways that is why i am a bit confused and curious to know the answer to this please. where can we get the answers to these queries? it would be great if you can help me getting answers to these queries. thanks gurmeet kaur,gurmeet we explain the basics of python in the very first chapter. we also explain each of the key functions in detail as and when we progress through the course. but as we progress through the code we may not go line by line as we have seen similar code earlier. if you do not understand any segment of code feel free to put it in the comments section under the video. we would respond with a clarification. it is impossible to cover all the ways to achieve the same task as there are sometimes tens of ways to do the same using different functions and libraries. we try and provide one of the more commonly used and efficient ways. additionally we want our students to have the ability to navigate through ml code comfortably by the end of the course. hence we avoid going over code line by line in the later chapters of the course as similar concepts have been covered in earlier chapters. if there is some new concept we would surely go over it in detail. we want our students to put in the effort to understand the code on their own especially in later chapters as they would have to do it in their jobs once they complete the course. if there is any blocker we are always here to help. please call us on 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 to learn more about this.

hi what is likelihood log-likelihood and maximum likelihood? what is maximum likelihood in logistic regression? thanks,1. given the observed data and a model of interest we need to find the one probability density function/probability mass function f x ? among all the probability densities that are most likely to have produced the data. to solve this inverse problem we define the likelihood function by reversing the roles of the data vector x and the distribution parameter vector ? in f x ? i.e. l ? x f x ? in mle we can assume that we have a likelihood function l ? x where ? is the distribution parameter vector and x is the set of observations. we are interested in finding the value of ? that maximizes the likelihood with given observations values of x . 2.maximum likelihood estimation mle is a technique used for estimating the parameters of a given distribution using some observed data. for example if a population is known to follow a normal distribution but the mean and variance are unknown mle can be used to estimate them using a limited sample of the population by finding particular values of the mean and variance so that the observation is the most likely result to have occurred. 3. for many applications the natural logarithm of the likelihood function called the log-likelihood is more convenient to work with. this is because we are generally interested in where the likelihood reaches its maximum value: the logarithm is a strictly increasing function so the logarithm of a function achieves its maximum value at the same points as the function itself and hence the log-likelihood can be used in place of the likelihood in maximum likelihood estimation and related techniques.
hi sir does this course help me in solving kaggle problems or will be in a position to face the kaggle competitions after completion of this course,yes we solved many real world problems in our case studies taken from the kaggle.
hi team i have around 10 years of experience in it industry mainly with java and related technologies. currently working as technical lead. should i consider shifting to ml ai domain now? also does this course covers ai as well or only ml?,this course covers the breadth of techniques across ml and ai which are currently relevant to the industry. given your experience it is best if you could call us and discuss this over the phone where we could understand your background and answer your questions better. please call us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583.
hi is this course contains the concept of objects classes constructors and destructors ???????,no they are not covered in this course.
i do not have knowledge on libraries like numpy pandas....and all other libraries used in ml is there any detailed explanation of these libraries in this course?,yes we will explain how to use numpy and pandas etc in the course.
hi i am interested to pursue this course online. so as a part of this will i be installing any software s during the course duration? if so then what should be the basic configuration of the laptop that i use while pursuing this course online?,for gpu you can go with 1050ti nvidia graphic card or 1060 or 1070. try to assemble an ssd with 128g. keep a minimum of 8g ram preferable 16g. the hard disk is your call.
hi i have a total of 8 years of experience in siebel crm data migration. i have enrolled in this course last month and am really excited and i must say i am really enjoying it. but i do have some concerns as well. since i have a lot of experience in crm particularly in migrating data from legacy systems to siebel databases : 1. are there opportunities in ml on crm data in big companies? 2. i would like to do 2-3 case studies in crm area will applied ai team support and mentor me in understanding the crm scenarios and help me in completing the case studies? 3. do companies hire 8 years experience guy like me with fresh knowledge of ml considering the ctc expectation would be high compared to other fresh graduates who have completed the course? very much appreciate your reply on this. thank you very much regards mohammed arif,1. yes some of the largest crm software developers like salesforce have invested heavily in ai and built tools like einstein. so crm is certainly a very fertile area for applications of ai as it contains lots of text and customer data. 2. certainly as you progress through the course we will work closely with you to build a portfolio of projects around the crm field as it is your corer area of expertise. we will need lots of inputs from you on the domain-knowledge front as we are not experts in crm. but we can certainly will mentor you o the ml front. 3. we have had students who have transitioned to ml roles with your kind of experience. but the effort needed would certainly be more as you will have to prove your ml expertise domain expertise as employers would expect more advanced case-studies in your portfolio. employers do pay a premium for domain expertise which is critical for most ml projects. i think it is too early to talk about compensation now but we will put in our best efforts to land you in the best possible role based o your expertise.
hi is your job placement support restricted to india or you have tie-up with uae dubai abu dhabi companies as well? thanking you in advance for your valuable reply.,we currently have the job-guarantee limited to india and us only. we have not yet expanded and built our recruiter partner network in the middle-east.
how does ridge regression solves multicollinearity?why lasso do not?,yes ridge regression used when the data suffers from multicollinearity independent variables are highly correlated . in multicollinearity even though the least squares estimates ols are unbiased their variances are large which deviates the observed value far from the true value. by adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates ridge regression reduces the standard errors. ridge regression solves the multicollinearity problem through shrinkage parameter ? lambda . have a look at the link here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/104779/why-does-ridge-regression-work-well-in-the-presence-of-multicollinearity
hi i already went before through the link but could not get intuation.could you pls simplify a bit more. and why do not lasso ya i got that it sparsity very easily through your video.but why not solves multicollinearity? . thanks.,if two predictors are highly correlated lasso can end up dropping one rather arbitrarily. that's not very good when you are wanting to make predictions for a population where those two predictors are not highly correlated perhaps a reason for preferring ridge regression in those circumstances.
thanks.how does multicollinearity affects random forest?actually i encountered this question.,in terms of prediction it does not affect much if the effect of multi-collinearity presents in both the train and test. however feature importance score would be influenced just like other methods such as linear/logistic regression. the explanation can be simplified if we consider two collinear variables. if two strong variables are chosen for a decision tree in rf one must be picked for each split consideration and the other would not likely be picked again since the former has already explained the output variation for both of them . the prediction power of that tree does not drop though so does the rf. however in feature importance score once one of the two is picked the other variable is less important to bring any further output variation explanation since the two are correlated well. the overall importance of these two will be reduced
hi applied ai team seaborn topic is not covered in eda without basics unable to understand the code related to the seaborn package can anyone help me on it. thank you regards bayaprakash,if you know matplotlib seaborn is quite straightforward to understand and implement. have a look at this: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/seaborn/index.htm
does this course contains - 1. opencv 2. audio recognition topics including audio preprocessing,1. we do cover opencv to the extent we need for our case-studies involving self-driving car. we donot dive deep into opencv as this is not a computer vision course. 2. we perform lots of time-series analysis using fourier transforms and discuss about spectrograms as a featurization of audio data. we have a case-study about music generation where we touch upon some audio topics like music encodings. but as this is not an audio-processing course we do not dive too deep into audio-signal processing and dive deep into techniques like mel frequency cepstral coefficients mfcc . as part of our course you will gain the ability to learn many concepts in cv and audio-processing and use these concepts for ml tasks. we have had students who learned about and used mfcc to build singer detection systems. similarly our students were able to pick up sift and other feature engineering techniques in cv and apply ml models on top of them.
from where i can learn opencv?,please go through this link.
hi team please correct me if i am wrong 1. c.i. is tool/technique which is using to making rough not exact calculated estimation about data. 2. it gives us confidence that my calculation or understanding about data is x of range is right rather than throwing stones in the darkness. but do we need to take samples of data every time like it should not be mandatory activity right? thanks.,yes c.i gives you a range of values for a random-variable like mean height of students in a class and a confidence level 95 associated with it to signify our confidence in this range. without samples of x or the parameters of the distribution like mu and sigma for normal disb of x we cannot come up with a c.i. i think this question does not belong in this comment section. please post questions under the respective and relevant videos.
hi i am very new to ml just covering statistics in udemy. my 3 questions. 1. is it possible to get lifetime access and can i get access all case studies? 2.i am beginner how many hours i need to spend per day to complete course and hands on? 3. do i get certification and mentor to guide me?,hi selva kumar 1. we are currently restricting the access to one year only to ensure that students are disciplined to complete the course on time. 2. please use this sheet to fill in your effort so that we can give you a detailed topic-wise timeline that an average student of our course has taken to complete the course. you will get a detailed timesheet with efforts and duration within a day. 3. you will get a certificate upon course completion. we have a dedicated team to help you throughout the course answering your queries and questions within 24 hrs. you will also get a mentor to help you with your own case-studies and help you prepare better for placements once you complete 50 of the assignments in the course. please call us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 to know more.
hi team i have one question which may seem silly:- ok. suppose i did eda and came out with some observations and intuation about data eg. after univariate bivariate descriptive etc. analysis like how data is distributed related segmented . now what we do with these observations before fitting to sklearn model eg. logisticregression .fit ? i mean what is the purpose of these and where it is used for before fitting into model ? is its done to select features by identifying and dropping the non-useful features engineer features derivation of new features impute missing values and handle outliers------- so that we can have refined dataset to feed into the models is the quoted sentence is the sole purpose to get and collect intuation by eda? thanks,yes you are right. there are more reasons for it as well: 1. let's take for example you would want to apply gaussian naive bayes. now the assumption is that the features are supposed to be gaussian distributed and this requires us to explore our data to determine the distribution of our features. 2. you can also perform use correlation tests to explore which features are collinear this creates a problem of interpretability of weight vectors in logistic/linear regression . there are many such reasons why eda is necessary and on a case to case basis you recognize what kind of eda you would perform.
please tell this course covers all the aspects required for cloudera certification cca ccp or not?,this is not a course on cloudera certification for cloudera big data platform. we cover ml and ai in this course which are not part of ccp or cca.

hi team i was just going through your free videos. i was watching this video of eda with iris dataset unfortunately i was not able to plot a 2d scatter plot with petal length and petal width instead i could plot it with sepal length and sepal width. can you please guide me through this code so that i can identify the problem as i am looking forward to enroll for this course.,kindly go through these blogs: 1. https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ 2. https://medium.com/codebagng/basic-analysis-of-the-iris-data-set-using-python-2995618a6342
hi team what is word2vec embedding ?are we covering this?where it is used in nlp? thanks,word embedding is one of the most popular representation of document vocabulary. loosely speaking they are vector representations of a particular word. word2vec is one of the most popular technique to learn word embeddings using shallow neural network. yes we discussed the concept of word2vec in detail and how exactly it works in nlp.
thanks team. could you pls give the link for word embedding in the course content. and thumbs up for your effort.well done.,it has been covered in the multi-layered perceptron section of the course. check here
hello sir i found your content interesting but unfortunately i downloaded the ipython notebooks i am wondering why i can not use jupyter notebook as a tool it always get open in the browser. i would like to know if i can really use it as a tool or i always have to use it in the browser if so how will i save my notes and whenever i download this ipython notes it does not open in the format of jupyter notebook infact it gives me multiple option such as ms word notepad etc.can i use spyder for the same? or is it that the code of spyder can not run in jupyter or vice-versa. please help me with this as i am new to programming language and also looking forward to join this course.,the jupyter notebook app is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. so you need to start the application with jupyter notebook on the terminal. if you would like to use it with an editor you have to convert it to .py file. have a look at this and this. your notebooks can be saved and edited like regular python scripts just that you will be required to open it by launching it on your local system.
thanks sir i would just like to know whether i can use spyder 3.6 for the same and another challenge is to install packages from command prompt whenever i use pip3 it states pip3 is not recognized.,1. it might either be that you have not added python to your system variables: https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path or just try pip instead and see if it works. 2. you can launch spyder with the anaconda navigator.

hi all who are searching for an appropriate ai course i am a current student of this course from a considerable amount of time. i can say undoubtedly this is the best course in all means for a ml aspirant. below are a few super points about this course and the team. extensive list of contents good assignments job opportunities extremely responsible team to respond to your queries during course all you have to do is complete the course successfully. thanks shashi,thanks for your kind review.
team what are other additional case studies that you plan to add in. should we assume that this course is now fully complete. i mean is there materials in the process of being added in near future? just asking. i am already happy super-excited with everything here. i am just asking to be more proud of this course,we keep adding and modifying content as per students' feedback and new ways we find to improve our content. our content is dynamic and ever-evolving. we are also working with our students on more case-studies. if we have a good and interesting case study we could add it to this course at a later time.
i am a java developer experience of 4 years in it industry how this course is going to help me out as i am new to this domain and companies will consider me a fresher during hiring process. so is this course enough to start in the field of ml/ai?,we have had students who have successfully transitioned to careers in ml with similar backgrounds as yours. please give us a call at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 to discuss in more detail about your job prospects.
is this course will be a benefit for a fresher i am 2018 graduate i consult many it employee's they said that as a fresher lesser oppurtunitie's in datascience or ml is it true,there are lots of opportunities for freshers who can showcase their real-world ml problem-solving skills by building a strong portfolio of projects. you can find many success stories of freshers that we worked with on this page. for more details please reach out to us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583
is this course applied ai course equal or better or lesser than a masters degree in data science/machine learning? what does a masters degree cover that is not covered here? and what is covered in applied ai that is not covered at a masters degree compare and contrast applied ai vs a masters degree,a typical master's degree focusses on theoretical breadth and depth and prepares you for a phd program if you choose to pursue it. some universities do offer more practical courses but lack in their scope of real-world problem-solving skills. of course based on the university the master's degree could be a very valuable signal to recruiters/companies. in most universities during your master's program you all learn lots of other subjects like operating systems algorithms databases etc. applied ai course focusses a lot on applied/practical skills while building up your basics needed for ml/ai. you can think of it as a shorter path to transitioning into an ml career. we have many students who are currently pursuing masters in some of the world's best universities taking our course to primarily build up their practical ml skills and build a portfolio to land an ml job. so masters and aaic are not disjoint. you can do both or either of them based on your career interests and goals.

sir i have heard that data scientists spend 90 of their time doing data preprocessing cleaning web crawling and various other things on unstructured data . does this course cover deeply how to handle the unstructured data ???,that's true. we cover lots of tools and techniques on handling unstructured data including text and images in lots of detail. we learn most of these tools through real-world examples in various chapters across the course.
please add videos on vc dimension. sir this being a part of machine learning should be present in this course. sir there were requests long time back but no additions have been made. i would be thankful if you could add videos on vc dimension.,here is a video we made on vc dimension: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/vc-dimension/ we added this video to the miscellaneous topics instead of the svm chapter. additionally the concept of vc-dimension while an interesting concept in statistical learning theory has very few applications in real-world applied ml/ai. hence we did not have it in the first iteration of the course.
please explain me in detail where this will be useful for me after complete this course? thank you,unfortunately since we do not know your background we are unable to give you a specific answer. please reach out to us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we can have a chat with you about how this course can help you.
why predictive analysis is not covered in the course? is not it important for machine learning and data analysltics? please advice on the above questions,could you please elaborate on what you mean by predictive analysis? did you mean predictive analysis or analytics? if you meant predictive analytics it mostly involves the techniques we have discussed in detail in our course. please check this wikipedia link for predictive analytics and observe that the techniques listed there are all covered in our course in detail.
hi team i am from non programming background but i have some knowledge in python at-least can able write functions upto 8-10 lines of code i m able to cover this course and how are the assignments sessions will you provide step by step blueprint/process in solving the assignments not asking for solutions and will you guys teach and cover tensorflow and keras library concepts completely seems the tutorial for both the libraries something like 2 hrs please help me out these three issues thank you,we recommend you watch our free videos after creating an account. you will also come across some of our assignments in the free content itself. these assignments and free content will help you understand how hard or easy our assignments are. we strongly recommend you attempt to solve at least one of these assignments to self-evaluate yourself to determine if this course is appropriate for you or not.
wow.. what a swift reply this seems your team is proven customer centrist team great job definitely look in to the assignments .,you will learn tf and keras basics in the first few hours and revisit them throughout our deep-learning chapters and case studies. most of our students do not face major challenges with tf and keras once they have gone through our course and assignments.

will it be an issue if i install anaconda 3.7 as the latest software is reflecting as 3.7.,it comes with python3.7. the problem with python 3.7 is that we do not have a tensorflow version which supports this. so install anaconda that comes with 3.6
please provide me the link i am unable to find the link for 3.6.,it's already there in the description: https://repo.continuum.io/archive/anaconda3-5.2.0-windows-x86_64.exe
hello i am working as a software engineer in a start up and i am very much interested in ai and want to learn it from you guys.i will pour my heart out in learning the course and to follow the schedule and complete it within the specified time.but to be on safer side i want to know that if in case i miss the deadline of finishing the course in one year will you guys provide me some paid extension for say two or three months to complete the course.this will occur rarely but asking it for safety.,please reach out to us at 91 8106-920-029 or 91 6301-939-583 so that we can talk to you in person.
how do you guys provide jobs to freshers in the field of ml which has most jobs where some experience is required,our success stories have many freshers who have landed in ml jobs after completing this course. while experience is important many companies are willing to hire freshers if they can showcase their real-world and applied knowledge of ml by solving practical problems by building a portfolio of projects that they have solved which includes code plots and detailed blogs. there is no scarcity of jobs in ml for people with the right practical skills which we try and teach through the course.
are you gonna cover deployment and runtime model prediction as well?,we have covered many of the details about deployment and continuous monitoring of models in this course. but the exact specifics of deployment depend a lot on the infrastructure architecture and platforms used by different teams. hence we give an overview of the choices we have without going into lots of detail as the specifics would be very team and project specific.

in your course you teach developing ml models using python. but python code can not be uploaded in any micro controller. so do you guys teach developing ml models in c or c so that such code can be uploaded in micro controller for remote real time application.,good question. we currently do not teach building ml models in c/c as there is not good support for c/c for many ml tasks. we preferred to use python in this course as it the most popular choice in the industry for most ml tasks. it is possible to build a model in python and port it to c/c code easily which is very common in the industry for latency requirements and we describe that in detail in this video.
the video you shared shows 'content of the item is restricted'. can you guide me how after completing your course i will be able to make ml models in c/c .,if you are not an enrolled student you may not be able to access all of the course content. translating models from python to c/c for deployment is fairly straightforward as most models involve simple matrix/array/logical operations as shown below. 1. logistic regression linear regression: multiply two vectors/arrays 2. decision tree randomforest and gbdt: nested if-else statements. 3. deep-learning models: sequence of n-dim array multiplications. 4. svm: sum of products of arrays. you might still want to train the models in python as there are tons of good libraries to do so. but when it comes to productionizing the models on a microcontroller you can port these models easily to c/c /asm code as most ml models involve mostly n-dim array operations or logical operators at run-time. training models on a microcontroller may be hard as you will need to write lots of code in c/c and training a model is compute memory and power intensive which you do not want to perform on a microcontroller.
thanks for your reply. looking forward to joining applied ai course. just a suggestion. it will be very helpful if you guys cover building ml models in c/c . because restricting the course till python and research is not justice to our skills which we will be developing through your course. at the end anything we develop must have some market value.,we strongly believe that you will be able to easily build c/c production models at the end of this course if you are already proficient in c/c . if there are any issues in that regard as you progress through the course we will surely help you. from our own experience it is not optimal to choose multiple languages in this course as that could create confusion and overwhelm many of the students.
why eda topic has been introduced before covering probability and statistics ?,we introduce many concepts in probability and stats and plotting in eda chapter itself. eda chapter takes a practical example to help students understand concepts from a practical standpoint using plots and graphical means.
sir are there any plans of preparing videos on gans boltzman machines rbms etc ??......the applications of them were quite interesting.,yes we will introduce some of these new topics to the course in the next few weeks. you will get an email update of new videos added to the course.

hi i am interested in this course. so i want to know that what kind of laptop configuration is good for ml and deep learning course since i have heard that it requires a lot of processing power to run smoothly. i have searched a lot over the internet but still i am confused. please help me. thanks,we keep most of our deep-learning case studies simple enough so that all of our students can try them out on their basic laptops. but if are keen to get a new system for deep-learning it is cost effective to buy a desktop with nvidia graphics cards like gtx 1060 1070 or 1080 based on your budget. laptops with comparable configurations cost much more than desktops.
hi there do you cover nlp in the course?,we have partly covered the nlp concepts in our course. we have discussed some of the techniques like bag of words tf-idf word2vec average word2vec etc

why increasing or decreasing c causes overfit or underfit.? what is the mathematics reason behind regularization or c parameter here. can anyone help me to understand how it would effect when we start taking the derivatives of cost function? i do not get a clear picture of what does penalizing the coefficient means? similarly in the logistic regression regularization equation. why increasing or decreasing lambda effects derivative of cost function. it will be very helpful if anyone can take some dummy numbers and help me understand what we mean by penalizing coefficient in both svm and logistic?,this has been explained in detail as the tradeoff between loss-minimization and regularization in the following videos in the corresponding chapters of logistic regression and svms. a shorter and simpler intuitive explanation can be found here: audio reply
why is the equation of plane in svm taken w t x b 1? is it same as straight line equation. why perpendicular vector w is taken as coefficient? where it came from?,the eqn of a plane that does not pass through origin is w.x b 0 can also be written as w.x b' 1 if b' b 1. we take the eqn of two planes to be w.x b /- 1 and not w.x b 0 in the case of svm as we have two planes: one for ve hyperplane with rhs 1 and another for -ve hyperplane with rhs -1. now the distance between these planes is 2/ w and this formulation shows that the ve and -ve hyperplanes are exactly at the same distance 1/ w from the separating hyperplane w.x b 0. we take the eqns in this form primarily to make the simpler for us to work with.
hi im from telecom background can you help me build portfolio on the basis of telecom background.. i want to work on telecom case studies. do you have it to help me so that i can enrol for this course,raghavendra the case studies we discuss will help you solve a wide spectrum of case studies across many domains. as part of your portfolio projects we encourage you to pick problems in your core domain which is telecom. we will surely work with you on solving these case-studies. first i recommend you complete the course content assignments and case-studies to get a good idea of ml and ai.
thanks for your response. i called to one of your team member and he said on phone that you will be giving problems on telecom domain so that i can build portfolio around that. could you please confirm if its true? i majorly need a curriculum build on telecom projects. few of my collegues are also interested but all r looking for projects around the domain.,i am glad you called us. we will certainly help you pick projects from telecom domain for your portfolio projects.
do you also teach how to deploy ml model/algos in production from an end to end perspective? what all infrastructure set up would be required for ml models to be up and running? also how frequently is it requiried to retrain or improve the models already deployed in production region?,we cover some of the key aspects like how to deploy models in various environments like low-latency and high-throughput systems how to use scikit-learn itself and when to build your custom function evaluation systems in this video called productizing models : https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/productionizing-models/ we also discuss when and how to retrain models in production here: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/retraining-models-periodically/ we discuss a/b testing models in production here:https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/a-b-testing/ we also discuss about the lifecycle of a project and real-world challenges here: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/data-science-life-cycle/ it is impossible to go over every possible production environment that can be used for ml deployment as the number of production configurations is very high. we also do not go into distributed ml as of now. but it should be easy to pick up these concepts as this course provides all the necessary fundamentals. if you have specific production environment in mind please email us with your phone number and we can discuss it in a 1-1 session. we have some data-scientist taking this course now whom we have helped with 1-1 sessions.
i am from programming background mobile apps and nodejs and understand the basics of python but i dont know math. does this course suitable for me.,sachin we will teach every thing from scratch. coming to math part we will cover all the things which are required for machine learning and deep learning. you can check out our syllabus.

hi team - will dis course also give me a good idea of analytics concepts as i think the fields are related.,this course will teach you concepts of data analysis probability statistics and data visualization which lie at the core of data-analytics. it teaches you all these concepts from a practical standpoint using python. what we do not teach are tools like tableau and excel which are simple ui tools to perform data analysis. we help you understand what is happening inside these tools and be able to build the functionality they provide from scratch in python.
hi team can you share any assessments on the python programming or any sample programs to solve in python.,we have actually posted some of the optional assignments in google classroom.
do we get to know about the case studies if we enroll to this course? or do we need to pay extra of 15000/- for each case study?,ram if you enrol for a full course you will get all case studies. please check out the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v kqeu5otd2-m
throughout your website you refer to this course as applied machine learning... whereas your courseware says applied ai ... . which one is correct? i know both are closely related but ai for sure is much broader than the ml if my understanding is correct. please clarify.,audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/appliedai-course/whatsapp-ptt-2018-06-15-at-152741
hi there i currently work in a product based company in tech support with an inclination towards machine learning honestly because it is an emerging and interesting field. i read all the comments in here just to be sure if this is the right and dependable place for a career change and i was quite convinced looking at the comments and your website. i did read that there is no prerequisite for joining this course. however i do not have any basic understanding of c c or java to be frank. the only thing i know is sql so would that be enough to understand the flow of the whole course and eventually land up into the job like you promise on your website taking the written criteria into consideration ? could you please give me a definitive answer if possible because i m really confused and could use a mentor? thanking you in advance you can also reach out to me at manishshinde9999@gmail.com,we recommend you watch our free videos on python in our course. if you can understand them there is no need for concern about understanding the programming part of the course. you can easily self evaluate yourself. please checkout the other videos of other concepts also as they will help you understand if you will be able to cope with the course content. knowing sql is very helpful as you will understand data processing much more easily than others who do not know it.
with mlaas platforms available with azure aws do we still need to have fair understanding of linear algebra / statistics / calculus ? and how your course complements these public cloud platforms will i still need them ?,most mlaas platforms help data-scientists ds build productionize deploy and iterate their solutions faster. they do not replace the deep-knowledge that ds needs to have to solve real-world problems well. we do not teach how to use azureml or aws-ml or google-ml in this course as of now. we teach the core-fundamentals of ml which will make picking up any of these platforms a week-end task. in the real-world you may still use many of these mlaas to speed-up your work and have access to cloud-scale compute storage and processes. a good analogy to mlaas is with compilers. compilers made programmers life simpler and made programming significantly faster but it did not replace programmers need for having a good grasp of programming languages and code-optimizations.
this course seems to be extremely focused on machine learning algorithms so - are you also going to add some intensive specific application of deep learning like some projects only related to computer vision like face detection ? if not please try to add these intensive projects too to make this course a exceptional one,we have covered deep-mlps cnns and rnns in lots of detail in the later chapters in this course. we also have computer-vision specific applications like building a self-driving car using deep-learning. we will certainly be adding more deep-learning case-studies in the future as this course content is very dynamic and evolving.
i support this idea. it would be great if we have a case study - text extraction from an image and classify the text using cnn. very much interested in ocr methods.,that would be fairly easy for you to learn and build as this course provides all of the necessary basics. we strongly encourage our students to be able to learn new concepts on thier own by the end of the course. we want our students to be life long leanrers leveraging tons of resources on the internet once they get the basics right. many of our students have taken up case studies on fairly advanced problems builidng upon the basics they learn in this course. if one of our students can opt in to take up this as thier case study for thier portflio we will help you though the case study. gskr82 are you up for it? for this specific problem there are two parts to it. first detect the part of the image that has text and then recognize the text using ocr. a quick google search provides the following resource which are easy to follow and build upon once you go though the course content: https://medium.com/syncedreview/stn-ocr-a-single-neural-network-for-text-detection-and-text-recognition-220debe6ded4 alternatively you can google search for text localization in images for detecting the location of text and then search ocr using cnn for the ocr component.
are you also going to cover tutorials of tableau for data visualization in the course because i think it's mostly used in industry ?,no we are not teaching tableau. while tableau is used in the industry it is a gui tool like microsoft excel. we are more focussed on core data analysis data visualization machine learning and deep learning wherein you learn how to build each of the visualizations available in tableau from scratch in python. the concepts you learn in this course will help you better understand how tableau's internal plotting systems work and which plotting tool to use based on context. by the end of this course you will be able to build a simplified version of tableau like tool in python.
as mentioned in your website so is it true that you people are giving 100 job guarantee . if yes on what basis you are giving this commitment i am sure there will be some term and conditions what are those?,here is a detailed explanation of the process and terms and conditions: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/job-guarantee/. this link is also available on our homepage in the top menu. if you prefer a video explaining the same please check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v sbgj5h3jnzu. we are very clear of our promise: if you finish the 30 mandatory assignments without plagiarism in the course which you can comfortably solve if you go through the video content and spend time-solving these assignments we will place you in an ml job within six months of completing the assignments. for some reason if we fail to do so we will refund your course fee.
good evening. i am looking for a class on multivariate regression multiple dependent variables . would this be covered as part of your course or if i register can you point to material that i can refer to?,one way to handle multivariate regression is to think of it as building k regressors if the output is a k-dimensional vector. we cover regressors in detail in the course. another method would be to train a nueral net that has k activation units in the last layer which we cover in detail in our nueral networks and deep learning sections. if you have specific problem that you want to solve we can certainly help you with the appropriate references.
good evening sir as r programming language is used in statistics works then why it is not being taught in your course...is there anyother contents present which you provide that substitute the requirement of that language?,today the most popular language for data-science ml and deep-learning is python. hence we have used python throughout this course and we teach python from scratch. while r is being used in some companies students who finish our course can easily pickup r as they have all the fundamentals of data-science ml and programming. our course is only a starting point in your journey in data-science and ml and not an end. we provide all of the basics needed for you to be a lifelong learner and to transition into an ml career.
