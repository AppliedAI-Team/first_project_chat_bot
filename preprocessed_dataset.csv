in your course you teach developing models using python but python code can notuploadedany micro controller soyou guys teach developing modelscc that such code canuploadedmicro controller for remote real time application,good question we currentlynot teach building modelsc c therenot good support for c c for many tasks we preferreduse pythonthis courseit the most popular choicethe industry for most tasks itpossiblebuildmodelpython and portto c c code easily whichvery commonthe industry for latency requirements anddescribe thatdetailthis video
